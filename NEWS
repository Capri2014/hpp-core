2009/08/28 Release 1.10.0

	1. Class ChppBody has been synchronized with hppModel implementation.

2009/07/11 Release 1.9.0

	1. Class ChppProblem has been  modified.
	  - a method solve has been added and some code has been moved from 
	    ChppPlanner::solveOneProblem to ChppProblem::solve.
	  - By default, when solving a path planning problem, the path 
            optimizer is not called if the path resulting from planning 
            contains only one direct path. This default behavior can now be 
            overriden by calling method ChppProblem::alwaysOptimize(true);

	2. The internal structure of the package has been changed in order to 
           use autotools in a more robust way.
