2012/02/11 Release 2.4

	1. Enable users to define several goal configurations.
	2. Some methods that used to return ktStatus now assert and return void.
	See porting notes in the documentation.

2012/02/03 Release 2.3

	1. Fix parser to handle devices that are not of type hpp::model::Device.
	2. addHppProblem, removeHppProblem, addHppProblemAtBeginning and
	   removeHppProblemAtBeginning are now virtual.

2012/01/27 Release 2.2

	1. Replace CkwsPathOptimizer by CkwsPathPlanner
	  CkwsPathPlanner is a more general class than CkwsPathOptimizer. This
          modification allows to post-process the solution of a path planning
	  problem with greater variety of algorithms.

2011/12/18 Release 2.1
        1. Use steering method component instead of simple steering methods.

2011/12/21 Release 2.0

2010/08/18 Release 1.12
	1. headers have been installed in include/hpp/core
	2. package is now managed by cmake
  	3. implementation of an extension of Kineo parser for ChppHumanoidRobot.
2009/08/28 Release 1.10.0

	1. Class ChppBody has been synchronized with hppModel implementation.

2009/07/11 Release 1.9.0

	1. Class ChppProblem has been  modified.
	  - a method solve has been added and some code has been moved from 
	    ChppPlanner::solveOneProblem to ChppProblem::solve.
	  - By default, when solving a path planning problem, the path 
            optimizer is not called if the path resulting from planning 
            contains only one direct path. This default behavior can now be 
            overriden by calling method ChppProblem::alwaysOptimize(true);

	2. The internal structure of the package has been changed in order to 
           use autotools in a more robust way.
