	    ChppPlanner::solveOneProblem to ChppProblem::solve.
	  - By default, when solving a path planning problem, the path 
            optimizer is not called if the path resulting from planning 
            contains only one direct path. This default behavior can now be 
            overriden by calling method ChppProblem::alwaysOptimize(true);

           use autotools in a more robust way.
