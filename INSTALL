Installation instructions

Configuration
-------------
untar the package
cd hppCore
mkdir build
cd build
../configure [OPTIONS]

  --disable-body : Configuration with dependence to hppModel 
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  hppCore can be compiled with a dependence to package hppModel that 
  provides implementation of the following classes:
    - ChppBody that implements a dynamic and geometric body. This class 
      derives from CkwsKCDBody for the geometric part and from an 
      implementation of CjrlBody for the dynamic part,

    - ChppDevice that implements a dynamic and geometric robot. This class
      derives from CkppDeviceComponent for the geometric part and from 
      an implementation of CjrlDynamicRobot for the dynamic part.

  --enable-body : Configuration with or without dependence to hppModel
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  If the dependence to hppModel is not required, hppCore provides a 
  simplified implementation of class ChppBody deriving from CkwsKCDBody.
