	First version of package that compiles with hppModel package.
	Robot modelling (dynamic part and geometric part) have been extracted from hppCore to hppModel.
	hppCore can now be installed 
	  either with a dependence to hppModel (implementing ChppDevice, ChppBody, ChppJoint)
	  or with a simplified implementation of ChppBody without dynamics but with enhanced distance computation facilities.

	Replaced ChppDevice by CkppDeviceComponent in ChppPlanner and ChppProblem since
	  1 ChppDevice derives from CkppDeviceComponent and
	  2 The operations performed on objects of this type only concern CkppDeviceComponent part.

	15. Added a default implementation of ChppPlanner::solve so that the class is not pure virtual.

hppCore 1.0.1 released July 20, 2007
	14. remove ChppColPair::dof since it was not used
	
hppCore 1.0 released July 10, 2007

	13. add a function in hppDevice to ignore another device (as its bounding box for example).

	12. Class ChppRoadmap has been moved into package kwsPlus (class CkwsPlusRoadmap) so that it can be used outside HPP.
	11. Modified files accordingly.
	10. Added information on main page.

	9. Added class ChppRoadmap in hppCore : This class allows users to display a roadmap in the scene. To do so, change every occurence
	of CkwsRoadmap by ChppRoadmap, and call method compute(), then display(). Calls to these methods must be done only after a
	solution path has been found. Linked Device must be ChppDevice.
	8. Replace occurences of kwsRoadmap by hppRoadmap.

	7. Removed @KWSIO_XXX@ from Makefile.am
	6. Moved first page of documentation to general documentation hppDoc.
	
2007/04/22
	5. Generate doxytag file to access this documentation from depending packages.
	4. Documentation is now compile at installation.

	3. Correction of a bug in function ChppProblem::ObstacleList(const std::vector<CkcdObjectShPtr>& inCollisionList): 
	the list of outer objects of each body of the robot was copied and each obstacle of the new obstacle list was added 
	at the end of the copy of the outer object list, but not in the outer object list.

	2. Added method 
	   ktStatus addHppProblemAtBeginning(ChppDeviceShPtr robot);
	   in ChppPlanner.
	1. Replaced std::vector by std::deque to store vector of problem,
	in order to be able to add a problem at the beginning of the vector.
