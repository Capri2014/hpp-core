	1. Added class ChppRoadmap in hppCore : This class allows users to display a roadmap in the scene. To do so, change every occurence
	of CkwsRoadmap by ChppRoadmap, and call method compute(), then display(). Calls to these methods must be done only after a
	solution path has been found. Linked Device must be ChppDevice.
	2. Replace occurences of kwsRoadmap by hppRoadmap.

	in order to be able to add a problem at the beginning of the vector.
