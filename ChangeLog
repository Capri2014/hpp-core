	Replace method findBodyByName by findBodyByJointName.
	* include/hppCore/hppPlanner.h,
	* src/hppPlanner.cpp: In case the bodies of a 
	device are not of type ChppBody, they do not have
	a name. It is therefore better to retrieve bodies
	by the name of the joint they are attached to.

	40. In ChppPlanner::solveOneProblem(): if direct path is valid between
	    initial and goal configurations, add it in the roadmap.
	39. Correction of a bug in ChppPlanner::solveOneProblem(). If the
	    steering method between initial and goal configurations returned
	    NULL, the function crashed.
	38. Added boolean argument in ChppPlanner::roadmapBuilderIthProblem to

hppCore 1.3 released February 18, 2008

	34. Added remove functions for hppProblemVector
	33. Make ChppCore class closer to hppModel implementation.
	32. Remove reference to kwsPlusRoadmap.
	31. Removed implementation of methods that have disappeared from
	    the ChppBody.
	30. Reorganization of header files to solve some compilation problems.
	29. Pre-release of version compiling with hppModel
	    (--disable-body). ChppBody and ChppDevice are now implemented
	    in hppModel. WARNING: some methods and attribute names might
	    have changed.
	28. Added ChppBody::addSolidComponent to add an object to a body
	    and insert it in the inner object list.
	27. Added virtual method ChppPlanner::initializeProblem() to
	    enable customized initialization of objects deriving from
	    ChppPlanner.
	26. Added functionalities to display a roadmap. Might be quickly
	    obsolete.
	25. void getInnerObjects(std::vector< CkcdObjectShPtr > & list);
	    and void getOuterObjects (std::vector< CkcdObjectShPtr > & list);
	    have been removed. Use CkwsKCDBody::innerObjects() and
	    CkwsKCDBody::outerObjects() instead.
	24. First version of package that compiles with hppModel package.
	23. Robot modelling (dynamic part and geometric part) have been
	    extracted from hppCore to hppModel.
	22. hppCore can now be installed either with a dependence to
	    hppModel (implementing ChppDevice, ChppBody, ChppJoint) or
	    with a simplified implementation of ChppBody without dynamics but
	    with enhanced distance computation facilities.

hppCore 1.2 released October 10, 2007

	21. When inserting a new problem, attach existing obstacles to the robot.
	20. Added API function to optimize a path.
	19. Added API functions to display a roadmap in the interface.
	18. Add virtual method ChppPlanner::initializeProblem(). This
	    method implemented in ChppWalkPlanner can thus be called by Corba
	    server.

hppCore 1.1 released August 27, 2007

	17. Replaced ChppDevice by CkppDeviceComponent in ChppPlanner and
	    ChppProblem since
	  1 ChppDevice derives from CkppDeviceComponent and
	  2 The operations performed on objects of this type only concern
 	    CkppDeviceComponent part.
	15. Added a default implementation of ChppPlanner::solve so that
	    the class is not pure virtual.
	17. Added a default implementation of ChppPlanner::solve.
	16. Improvement of collision information displaying.
	15. Call path opthmizer with the penetration specified for roadmap
	    builder.

hppCore 1.0.1 released July 20, 2007

	14. remove ChppColPair::dof since it was not used

hppCore 1.0 released July 10, 2007

	13. add a function in hppDevice to ignore another device (as its
	    bounding box for example).
	12. Class ChppRoadmap has been moved into package kwsPlus (class
  	    CkwsPlusRoadmap) so that it can be used outside HPP.
	11. Modified files accordingly.
	10. Added information on main page.
	9. Added class ChppRoadmap in hppCore : This class allows users to
 	   display a roadmap in the scene. To do so, change every occurence
	   of CkwsRoadmap by ChppRoadmap, and call method compute(), then
	   display(). Calls to these methods must be done only after a
	   solution path has been found. Linked Device must be ChppDevice.
	8. Replace occurences of kwsRoadmap by hppRoadmap.
	7. Removed @KWSIO_XXX@ from Makefile.am
	6. Moved first page of documentation to general documentation hppDoc.
	5. Generate doxytag file to access this documentation from depending packages.
	4. Documentation is now compile at installation.
	3. Correction of a bug in function ChppProblem::ObstacleList(const
	   std::vector<CkcdObjectShPtr>& inCollisionList):
	   the list of outer objects of each body of the robot was copied and
	   each obstacle of the new obstacle list was added
	   at the end of the copy of the outer object list, but not in the
	   outer object list.
	2. Added method
	   ktStatus addHppProblemAtBeginning(ChppDeviceShPtr robot);
	   in ChppPlanner.
	1. Replaced std::vector by std::deque to store vector of problem,
	   in order to be able to add a problem at the beginning of the vector.
