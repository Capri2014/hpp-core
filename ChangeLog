2007/11/19
	Remove reference to kwsPlusRoadmap.
2007/11/08
	Removed implementation of methods that have disappeared from the ChppBody.
	
2007/11/07
	Reorganization of header files to solve some compilation problems.

2007/11/05
	Pre-release of version compiling with hppModel (--disable-body). ChppBody and ChppDevice are now
	implemented in hppModel. 
	WARNING: some methods and attribute names might have changed.
	
2007/10/30
	Added ChppBody::addSolidComponent to add an object to a body and insert it in the inner object list.
	Added virtual method ChppPlanner::initializeProblem() to enable customized initialization of objects 
	deriving from ChppPlanner.
	Added functionalities to display a roadmap. Might be quickly obsolete.
	
2007/10/23
	void getInnerObjects (std::vector< CkcdObjectShPtr > & list);
	void getOuterObjects (std::vector< CkcdObjectShPtr > & list);
	have been removed use CkwsKCDBody::innerObjects() and CkwsKCDBody::outerObjects() instead.

2007/08/23
	First version of package that compiles with hppModel package.
	Robot modelling (dynamic part and geometric part) have been extracted from hppCore to hppModel.
	hppCore can now be installed 
	  either with a dependence to hppModel (implementing ChppDevice, ChppBody, ChppJoint)
	  or with a simplified implementation of ChppBody without dynamics but with enhanced distance computation facilities.

hppCore 1.2 released October 10, 2007
	
2007/09/30
	21. When inserting a new problem, attach existing obstacles to the robot.
	
2007/09/29
	20. Added API function to optimize a path.
	19. Added API functions to display a roadmap in the interface.
	
2007/09/12
	18. Add virtual method ChppPlanner::initializeProblem(). This method implemented in ChppWalkPlanner can thus be called by Corba server.
	
hppCore 1.1 released August 27, 2007

	17. Replaced ChppDevice by CkppDeviceComponent in ChppPlanner and
	    ChppProblem since
	  1 ChppDevice derives from CkppDeviceComponent and
	  2 The operations performed on objects of this type only concern
 	    CkppDeviceComponent part.
	15. Added a default implementation of ChppPlanner::solve so that
	    the class is not pure virtual.
	17. Added a default implementation of ChppPlanner::solve.
	16. Improvement of collision information displaying.
	15. Call path opthmizer with the penetration specified for roadmap
	    builder.
	
hppCore 1.0.1 released July 20, 2007

	14. remove ChppColPair::dof since it was not used
	
hppCore 1.0 released July 10, 2007

	13. add a function in hppDevice to ignore another device (as its
	    bounding box for example).
	12. Class ChppRoadmap has been moved into package kwsPlus (class
  	    CkwsPlusRoadmap) so that it can be used outside HPP.
	11. Modified files accordingly.
	10. Added information on main page.
	9. Added class ChppRoadmap in hppCore : This class allows users to
 	   display a roadmap in the scene. To do so, change every occurence
	   of CkwsRoadmap by ChppRoadmap, and call method compute(), then
	   display(). Calls to these methods must be done only after a
	   solution path has been found. Linked Device must be ChppDevice.
	8. Replace occurences of kwsRoadmap by hppRoadmap.
	7. Removed @KWSIO_XXX@ from Makefile.am
	6. Moved first page of documentation to general documentation hppDoc.
	5. Generate doxytag file to access this documentation from depending packages.
	4. Documentation is now compile at installation.
	3. Correction of a bug in function ChppProblem::ObstacleList(const
	   std::vector<CkcdObjectShPtr>& inCollisionList):
	   the list of outer objects of each body of the robot was copied and
	   each obstacle of the new obstacle list was added  
	   at the end of the copy of the outer object list, but not in the
	   outer object list.
	2. Added method 
	   ktStatus addHppProblemAtBeginning(ChppDeviceShPtr robot);
	   in ChppPlanner.
	1. Replaced std::vector by std::deque to store vector of problem,
	   in order to be able to add a problem at the beginning of the vector.
